## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Building

It automatically builds and deploys on commit to main thanks to the deploy.yml!
To make sure it works before pushing, try

```bash
npm run build
```

and check the /build-folder to make sure everything looks as it should.
